# Now, Later, Never: A Study of Urgency in Mobile Push-notifications

**Authors:** Beatriz Esteves, Kieran Fraser, Shridhar Kulkarni, Owen Conlan, Víctor Rodríguez-Doncel

**Abstract:**
Push-notifications, by design, attempt to grab the attention of subscribers and impart new or valuable information in a particular context. These nudges are commonly initiated by marketing teams and subsequent delivery interruptions tend to conflict with subscriber priorities and activities. In this work, we present a definition of urgency applied to notifications. We describe its value in an ontology for push-notification annotation and also evaluate a variety of classification models tasked with distinguishing urgency levels in notification text. The best model achieved an F1-score of 0.89. The proposed models have the potential to benefit subscribers by helping them better prioritize incoming notifications and also aid marketers in creating time-relevant campaigns.
